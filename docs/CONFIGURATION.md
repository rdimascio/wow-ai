# Configuration reference

Everything the bridge reads: `config.json` in its home folder (`~/.claude-wow`, see [Where the bridge keeps its files](#where-the-bridge-keeps-its-files)), command-line flags, environment variables, and the files it writes there. `node setup.js` writes a working `config.json` from `bridge/config.example.json` (and brings an older one up to date); this page explains each key so you can tune it by hand.

The bridge reads `config.json` once at start. Restart it after editing, except for an agent's `allowedTools`, which the **Allow & retry** button updates live.

## Paths

| Key | Default (from `config.example.json`) | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `addonDir` | `…\World of Warcraft\_classic_beta_\Interface\AddOns` | The game's AddOns folder. The bridge writes the slot addons, `Inbox.lua` and every signal file under it. `setup.js` fills this in from the client it finds. |
| `inboxFile` | `<addonDir>\ClaudeWoW_Runtime\Inbox.lua` | The file the game reads on `/reload` (fallback path). Normally derived from `addonDir`; only change it if you moved the addon. A value still naming an old addon (`WoWAI`, `WoWClaude`) or the shipped `ClaudeWoW\Inbox.lua` is ignored in favour of the derived one. |
| `savedVariablesFile` | `…\WTF\Account\<account>\SavedVariables\ClaudeWoW.lua` | The addon's saved data. The bridge polls it for the reload-path outbox. `setup.js` picks the first account under `WTF\Account`; pass `--account <name>` to choose another. |
| `defaultCwd` | `C:\path\to\your\project` | Folder for chats that have not chosen one with `/claude cd`, when the bridge is started from inside this repo (`npm start`). See [Which folder the agent works in](#which-folder-the-agent-works-in). |
| `claudeDir` | `$CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`, else `~/.claude` | Claude Code's own folder. `/claude -r` lists the recent sessions from its `history.jsonl` (names from the session files' titles) and looks up an id it was given in `projects/`; a running session's id comes from `sessions/<pid>.json`. The bridge only reads here. |
| `claudeSessions` | `true` | `false` keeps Claude Code's sessions out of `/claude -r`: only the bridge's own chats and the running sessions are listed and resumable. |
| `titleModel` | `"claude-haiku-4-5"` | The model that names a new chat from its first message. It runs through the Claude Code CLI with no tools and no saved session, next to the agent's run; the reply waits up to 4 s for it. Until it lands, the chat shows its first words. `false` turns it off. |

## Agents

| Key | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `agent` | `"claude"` | The agent for chats that have not picked one with `/claude -c --agent`. One of `claude`, `codex`, `grok`, `agy`, `hermes`, `local`; the bridge refuses to start on anything else. |
| `agents.<id>` | one block per agent | That agent's settings, below. A missing block means the defaults. |

Keys under `agents.claude`, `agents.codex`, `agents.grok`, `agents.agy` and `agents.hermes` (what each one means per agent is spelled out in [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md)):

| Key | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `permissionMode` | `"acceptEdits"` | `acceptEdits` auto-approves file edits inside the working folder; `bypassPermissions` approves everything; `default` approves nothing beyond what `allowedTools` names. Claude gets it as `--permission-mode`; for Codex it picks the sandbox (`read-only` / `workspace-write` / none); for Grok it becomes `--permission-mode dontAsk` plus allow rules, or `--always-approve` (headless Grok runs ordinary commands on its own and blocks dangerous ones unless a rule allows them; see [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md)). |
| `allowedTools` | git, npm, npx, node, python, pip, pytest, ls, dir, WebSearch, WebFetch | Rules in Claude Code's syntax: `Bash(git:*)` allows any command starting with `git`, `WebSearch` a tool. Passed to Claude as `--allowedTools`, translated to Grok's `--allow` globs, ignored by Codex. The **Allow & retry** button in game appends rules here permanently. |
| `deniedTools` | `[]` | Rules the agent may never use, same syntax. Claude: `--disallowedTools`; Grok: `--deny`, which wins over everything, `bypassPermissions` included; ignored by Codex. |
| `model` | `""` | Passed to the CLI (`--model` / `-m`) when non-empty. Empty uses the CLI's default. |
| `path` | `""` | Full path to the executable. Empty means: look in the installer's folder, then (for Codex) `CODEX_BIN`, then `PATH`, then npm's launcher. A `.js` path is run with the bridge's Node (from the binary: the `node` on the `PATH`, so an npm-installed CLI still works). |
| `extraArgs` | `[]` | More command-line arguments, added verbatim (before Codex's `resume` subcommand). |
| `networkAccess` (codex only) | `false` | `true` lets commands inside Codex's `workspace-write` sandbox reach the network (`-c sandbox_workspace_write.network_access=true`). |

### The local agent

`agents.local` runs chats on a model on your own PC, through any server that speaks the OpenAI chat completions API. It costs nothing per message. It is never the default: pick it per chat with `/claude --agent local`, or set `"agent": "local"`.

| Key | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `baseUrl` | `"http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1"` | The server's OpenAI base URL. The bridge posts to `<baseUrl>/chat/completions`. The game context and your messages go to this address, so keep it on your own PC. |
| `model` | `"Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507-Q4_K_M"` | The `model` field of each request. `llama-server` serves the one model it loaded, whatever this says. `/claude --model` overrides it per chat. |
| `timeoutMs` | `120000` | How long one request to the server may take. The bridge's own `timeoutMs` still ends the whole run. |

The suggested model is Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507 at Q4_K_M (about 2.5 GB). Start it with [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp)'s `llama-server`:

```sh
llama-server -hf lmstudio-community/Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507-GGUF:Q4_K_M --jinja -c 32768 --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8080
```

`--jinja` is needed for tool calls. Without it the model still answers, but it cannot use the game data tools.

What it does:

- The bridge runs `bridge/localagent.js` (`claude-wow local-agent` in the binary). It reads the system prompt and the message on stdin and prints Claude Code's stream-json, so the window shows progress, the session id and the context size as for Claude. The cost shows as $0.
- In `ask` chats it gets the read-only `wowdata` tools from the same per-run MCP config Claude gets, and calls them in a loop of at most 6 tool steps. It has no web search, no files, no shell, and none of the `wowgoals` tools (goals, orders, campaigns stay Claude only).
- A chat's history is kept in `~/.claude-wow/local-sessions/<session id>.json` (the last 40 messages, at most 200 chats), so `/claude -c` continues it.
- A small model follows the rules for game names less reliably than Claude. Treat its answers as a cheap first try.

A `config.json` from before agents existed kept Claude's settings at the top level (`claudePath`, `model`, `permissionMode`, `allowedTools`). The bridge still reads them, under anything in `agents.claude`; `setup.js` moves them down.

## Plugins

| Key | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `plugins.default` | `"ask"` | The plugin for chats that are not bound to one (`plugin=` flag): `ask` (general in-game chat) or `claude-code` (an agent session in a folder). The bridge refuses to start on a name it does not have; `--help` lists them. |
| `plugins.<id>.agents.<agent>.model`, `.effort` | unset | The model and effort that plugin's chats run with, over `agents.<agent>`. A chat's own `--model` / `--effort` still wins. Example: `"ask": { "agents": { "claude": { "model": "claude-sonnet-5-5", "effort": "medium" } } }` keeps quick in-game questions off a max-effort Opus default. Only `model` and `effort` are read; other keys are ignored. |
| `plugins.ask.cwd` | `""` | The scratch folder the `ask` plugin runs the agent in (it has no project). Empty = the per-user application data folder (`~/Library/Application Support/claude-wow/ask` on macOS, `%LOCALAPPDATA%\claude-wow\ask` on Windows, `~/.local/share/claude-wow/ask` on Linux), created on demand. |

| `plugins.live.enabled` | `true` | `false` keeps the bridge from opening the live-session socket (`live.sock` in the home folder). |
| `plugins.live.waitMs` | `3000` | How long a message on a `live` chat waits for a Claude Code session to connect before the chat is told there is none. |
| `plugins.live.timeoutMs` | `timeoutMs` | How long a `live` message waits for the session's `wow_reply`. |
| `plugins.live.permissionTimeoutMs` | `120000` | How long a permission prompt relayed as a roll waits before it is denied. See [LIVE-SESSION.md](LIVE-SESSION.md). |

A `config.json` without a `plugins` block keeps working: the default applies. Chats made before plugins existed are bound to `claude-code` by the addon, so they behave as before whatever the default is.

## Runs

| Key | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `gameContext` | `true` | Put the character/zone context the addon sends at the top of every message as a marked situation block (and the rules for reading it, the map and macro instructions and the primer into the agent's system prompt). `false` ignores it, for a bridge only ever used on unrelated projects. The addon has its own switch, `/claude config context off`, which also clears what the bridge holds. |
| `primerFile` | `"docs/WOW-ADDON-PRIMER.md"` | A markdown file appended to the system prompt while the addon sends a game context, whatever folder the chat works in: how to write addons and macros for this client. Relative to the claude-wow folder (from the binary: to `~/.claude-wow/assets`, where the binary writes its copy, so an edit there lasts until a new binary replaces it), or absolute. Re-read on every run, so edits count at once for new chats (Claude Code records a chat's system prompt at its first message and keeps it for the chat's life). `""` sends none. Off whenever the context is off. |
| `achievements` | `true` | Award achievement toasts for dev milestones the bridge sees in the agent's tool calls (see README, "Achievement toasts"). `false` stops the detection and ships no toasts. The earned list is kept in `state.json` under `achievements`. |
| `maxParallel` | `3` | How many chats may run an agent at the same time. Further messages queue per chat. |
| `timeoutMs` | `1800000` (30 min) | A run longer than this is killed (with its children) and reported as an error in game. |
| `killGraceMs` | `5000` | When the bridge ends a run (the timeout above, or its own stop on Ctrl+C / `claude-wow service stop`), how long the run's process group gets after `SIGTERM` before `SIGKILL`. Every child the bridge starts leads its own process group on macOS and Linux, so the agent and whatever it shelled out to go together; a child that ignores `SIGTERM` is still gone after this. Windows uses `taskkill /T /F` at once. |
| `progressWriteMs` | `3000` | Minimum gap between progress writes to the slot files. Final replies are written immediately. |
| `pollMs` | `750` | How often the bridge checks the SavedVariables file for a reload-path message. |

## Screen capture

Keys under `capture`:

| Key | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `enabled` | `true` | Run the outbound transport below. With `false` only the reload path works (`/claude config mode reload` in game). |
| `mode` | `"screenshot"` | Outbound transport. `screenshot` (the default; a config from before this key existed gets it too): no screen capture; the addon calls `Screenshot()` with the strip up for two frames and the bridge decodes the PNG/TGA the client writes to its `Screenshots` folder, then deletes it (files without a strip, i.e. your own screenshots, are left alone; strip-bearing leftovers from a bridge that was down are swept at startup and every 5 minutes). `pixel` (**deprecated**, kept only until `Screenshot()` is confirmed on Windows and on Linux under Wine): `capture.ps1` (Windows), `capture_mac.py` (macOS) or `capture_x11.py` (Linux) screen-captures the strip four times a second. The bridge names the mode in every slot file and the addon follows it; while the screenshot mode is on, the addon sets `screenshotFormat` to `png` and restores your value when it leaves the mode, when you log out, and at the next load if a crash skipped that. When the addon reports that it cannot shoot (`shot=missing`: no `Screenshot()`; `shot=failed`: every shot failed), the bridge falls back to `pixel` on its own, logs `TRANSPORT FALLBACK`, records `transportFallback` (`reason`, `at`, `session`) in `state.json` so the next start goes straight to pixels when `mode` is unset, and ships the reason as `transportNote` in the slot files for `/claude diag`. An explicit `mode` always wins over that memory. |
| `screenshotLevels` | `{ "off": 0, "on": 60 }` | `screenshot` mode only: the two levels (0-255) the strip's colour channels span. A screenshot is bit-exact, so dark levels read as well as bright ones and the strip is nearly invisible for the two frames it is up. Codec 2 spreads four levels evenly between them (0/20/40/60 by default) and the bridge reads the actual levels off each strip's ramp; codec 1 draws the two and the bridge decodes at the threshold halfway between them. `on - off` must be at least 8 or the default is used. The pixel transport ignores this and always draws full primaries. |
| `chatLog` | `{ "enabled": false, "line": 900, "filler": 50000, "show": false }` | `screenshot` mode only, experimental, off by default: the chat log transport ([ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md#the-chat-log-transport-experimental)). With `enabled: true` the addon writes each message into the client's own `Logs/WoWChatLog.txt` as local system lines and the bridge reads the file; no strip is drawn and no screenshot is taken on the first try. `line`: base64 characters per line (60-940; the key and the frame header add about 60 more, and 1,000-character lines are the longest measured). `filler`: bytes of padding lines written after each message so the client's write buffer fills and reaches disk (0-65536; the Forever client writes the log each time 49,152 bytes are buffered, measured 2026-09-30, so the default is 50,000; the bridge raises it when it measures a larger buffer and never lowers it below this value). `show: true` leaves the lines visible in the chat window, with `...` in place of the key, for a client where a hidden line is not logged. `clean: false` stops the bridge from removing its lines when the game is closed. Run `/claude probe chatlog` with `node dev/transport-probe.js` watching before turning it on. |
| `screenshotCodec` | `2` | `screenshot` mode only: which strip the addon draws. `2`: 2 px cells, four levels per channel, 400 cells a row (six bits a cell, eight times the payload per screen area: a typical message is one 800×2 px line, a 1 KB message 8 px tall). `1`: the pixel transport's 4 px cells with one bit per channel (a 1 KB message is 56 px tall), for a client whose screenshots turn out not to be exact at 2 px. The bridge decodes both whatever this says, so an addon from before the setting (which draws codec 1) keeps working. |
| `screenshotDir` | *(derived)* | `screenshot` mode: the client's `Screenshots` folder. Derived from `addonDir` (`<client>/Interface/AddOns` -> `<client>/Screenshots`) unless set. |
| `processName` | `"WowB"` | The game executable without `.exe`. `setup.js` sets it from the `Wow*.exe` it finds in the client folder (on macOS, from the binary inside the `.app` bundle). |
| `cellPx` | `4` | Codec 1 only (the pixel transport, and `screenshotCodec: 1`): pixel size of one strip cell. Must match `GEOMETRY[1]` in `addon/ClaudeWoW/Codec.lua`. Codec 2's geometry is fixed on both sides. |
| `cellsPerRow` | `200` | Codec 1 only: cells per strip row. Must match the addon. |
| `maxRows` | `48` | Codec 1 only: maximum strip rows captured. Must match the addon. |
| `intervalMs` | `250` | Capture period. Lower is more responsive and costs a little more CPU. |
| `python` | `"python3"` | Linux and macOS: interpreter for `capture_x11.py` / `capture_mac.py`, i.e. only the deprecated pixel transport (and the fallback to it). |
| `windowName` | `""` | Linux and macOS: find the game window by title substring instead of by process name (on Linux, by WM_CLASS `<processName>.exe`). |
| `keepComposited` | `false` | Linux: set `_NET_WM_BYPASS_COMPOSITOR=2` on the game window so the compositor keeps drawing it. Try it if `npm run probe` sees a black or stale strip in borderless fullscreen. |

The capture region is `cellsPerRow × cellPx` by `maxRows × cellPx` pixels (800 × 192 by default) at the top-left of the game's client area. In `screenshot` mode the strip is read from the top-left of the screenshot, which is the rendered frame, so it works on any display (a Retina display, where the screen capture cannot read the strip, included); codec 2's region is 400 × 48 cells of 2 px, 800 × 96, of which a message uses the top few pixels.

## Vision

| Key | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `vision.maxWidth` | `1280` | `screenshot` mode only. When a chat has `/claude config vision on` (or sends `/claude look ...`), the bridge cuts the strip's rows off the screenshot it decoded, scales the rest down to at most this many pixels wide (area averaging, so UI text stays readable) and attaches it to the run as a PNG. A 1080p frame becomes 1280x712, 1.5-2 MB; the Anthropic API takes images up to 5 MB and itself downscales anything past 1568 pixels on the long edge, so higher values buy little. |
| `vision.keep` | `6` | How many of those PNGs may sit in `~/.claude-wow/tmp` at once: one per message that asked, deleted when its run ends, so only runs that never started (a bridge killed mid-queue) leave one. The oldest beyond this are removed, and all of them when the bridge starts. |

## Slot pool and signal files

These sizes are baked into the files `install-slots.js` creates, and the addon has matching constants at the top of `addon/ClaudeWoW/ClaudeWoW.lua` (`SLOT_COUNT`, `ACT_MAX`, `PRESENCE_MAX`). Change all three places together, re-run `node bridge/install-slots.js`, and restart the game.

| Key | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `slots` | `200` | Reply-slot addons `ClaudeWoW_S001` … `ClaudeWoW_S200`. Each slot can be loaded once per UI session; `/reload` frees them all. |
| `actMax` | `60` | Heartbeat files per message (`act/NNN/01..60.wav`). The bridge deletes one per agent action. |
| `presenceMax` | `2000` | Presence files per ring (`presence/a/0001..2000.wav` and `presence/b/...`). The bridge deletes one per `presenceIntervalMs`. |
| `presenceIntervalMs` | `30000` | How often the bridge deletes a presence file so the in-game light stays green. |
| `tocInterface` | `"11509, 16001"` | `## Interface:` versions written into every slot addon's `.toc`: Classic Era and Forever, like the addon's own `.toc`. Bump it when a client's TOC version changes. Setup replaces the old default `"16001"`. |

## Command line

`claude-wow` (the installer's binary or shim, `npm link`, or the Homebrew formula) and `node bridge/bridge.js` take the same flags. `npm start` runs `bridge/supervisor.js`, which restarts the bridge on crash and passes flags through. The subcommands are handled by the supervisor itself:

| Subcommand | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `claude-wow setup [...]` | Runs `setup.js` with the given flags (see [`setup.js` flags](#setupjs-flags)). |
| `claude-wow service install\|uninstall\|start\|stop\|restart\|status\|logs [-n N] [-f]` | The bridge as a per-user background service that starts at login and comes back after a crash: a LaunchAgent on macOS, a systemd `--user` unit on Linux, a Startup-folder launcher on Windows. `status` exits 0 when running, 3 when not. See [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md#running-the-bridge). |
| `claude-wow bridge [...]` | `bridge.js` alone, in this process, with the flags below and no restarts. This is how the supervisor runs the bridge from the compiled binary, which has no node to hand a script path to (`bridge/runtime.js`); it works from a checkout too. |
| `claude-wow install-slots` | `install-slots.js` alone (setup runs it for you); from the binary, how setup runs it. |
| `claude-wow data sync [--flavor <name>] [--build <a.b.c.d>] [--force]` | Fetches one game's client tables from wago.tools into `data/<flavor>/<build>/` in the home folder: `--flavor forever` (the default; product `wow_cn_beta`, the newest `1.60.1` build) or `--flavor classic_era` (product `wow_classic_era`, the newest `1.15.9` build), unless `--build` names one. A build of the other flavor is refused before anything is fetched. Sync each game you play; the bridge picks the one that matches the client ([Game data](#game-data)). Nothing runs it on its own yet, and it never starts from game text. A build that is already current is skipped unless `--force`. Moving `current` to another build family needs `--build`. Exit codes: `0` done, `1` failed (the previous build stays current), `2` usage (unknown option, bad `--build`), `3` another sync holds the lock. See [Game data](#game-data). |
| `claude-wow data-mcp [--data <dir>] [--client-build <a.b.c.d>] [--flavor <name>]` | The read-only `wowdata` MCP server on stdio. The bridge starts it for Claude `ask` runs; you do not run it by hand. See [The wowdata server](#the-wowdata-server). |
| `claude-wow goals-mcp --socket <path> --run <id>` | The `wowgoals` MCP server on stdio: goals, orders, campaigns and routes for one Claude `ask` run, written by the bridge over its live socket. The bridge starts it with the run's token in `CLAUDE_WOW_RUN_TOKEN`; you do not run it by hand. See [LIVE-SESSION.md](LIVE-SESSION.md#goals-orders-and-campaigns-from-in-game-chats). |
| `claude-wow events [--follow] [--min N] [--character Name-Realm]` | Game events from the telemetry (`goals/<Name-Realm>/events.jsonl`), one JSON line each. Without `--follow` it prints the last 50 and exits; with it, it waits for new ones. See [Game state telemetry](#game-state-telemetry). Exit codes: `0` done, `1` no events file yet, `2` usage. |
| `claude-wow report [--day [YYYY-MM-DD]] [--character Name-Realm]` | One local calendar day (default today) for one character (default the newest events folder): level, money, deaths, zone, skill, recipe and watched item changes, the orders issued that day and each goal's progress. See [Daily report](#daily-report). Exit codes: `0` done, `1` no events or no folder, `2` usage. |
| `claude-wow --version` | The version and the runtime: `claude-wow 0.4.0 (node 24.21.0)`, `(bun 1.4.2)` or `(claude-wow binary (bun 1.4.2))`. |

Environment: `CLAUDE_WOW_SERVICE=1` is set by the service definitions and tells the supervisor to write its output to the service log and a pid file instead of a terminal; `CLAUDE_WOW_HOME` (below) is passed through to the service when set.

| Flag | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `--project <dir>` | Default working folder for this run. Overrides everything else. |
| `--once` | Handle one pending reload-path message and exit. |
| `--inject "<text>"` | Pretend the strip said this, run the agent, publish the result, exit. Handy for checking a setup without the game. |
| `--agent <id>` | Which agent `--inject` uses (default: `agent` from the config). |
| `--help`, `-h` | Print usage. |

Exit codes: `0` normal, `1` the injected or one-shot job failed, `2` config missing, unreadable or naming an unknown agent. The supervisor only restarts on codes other than `0` and `2`.

## Environment

| Variable | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `CLAUDE_WOW_HOME` | Where `config.json`, `state.json`, `transcripts.json`, `bridge.log`, `tmp/`, `mapjobs/`, `uijobs/`, `goals/` and `data/` live. Default `~/.claude-wow`; see [Where the bridge keeps its files](#where-the-bridge-keeps-its-files). |
| `CLAUDE_WOW_PROJECT` | Default working folder, below `--project` and above the start folder in precedence. The old name `WOW_AI_PROJECT` is still read. |
| `CLAUDE_WOW_MAC_BACKEND` | macOS pixel capture: `native`, `screencapture` or `auto` (`capture_mac.py --backend`). The old name `WOWAI_MAC_BACKEND` is still read. |
| `CLAUDECODE` | Removed from Claude's environment so a bridge started from inside a Claude Code session can still launch `claude -p`. |
| `GROK_DISABLE_AUTOUPDATER` | Set to `1` for Grok runs, so a headless run never stops for an update. |
| `GROK_HOME` | Honoured when looking for `grok.exe` (`<GROK_HOME>\bin`); Grok's own setting. |
| `CLAUDE_WOW_UI_FILE` | Set by the bridge for each run of a plugin with the `ui` surface: a file where the agent's tools append UI widget commands, one JSON object per line (see [UI-WIDGETS.md](UI-WIDGETS.md)). |
| `CLAUDE_WOW_MAP_FILE` | Set by the bridge for each run, whatever the agent: a file where the agent's tools append map commands, one JSON object per line (see [MAP.md](MAP.md)). |

## Which folder the agent works in

Each chat can pick its own folder with `/claude cd` or **Folder...** in the menu that opens when you right-click the chat in the left panel. Chats that have not are given the bridge's default folder, chosen in this order:

1. `--project <dir>`
2. `CLAUDE_WOW_PROJECT`
3. The folder the bridge was started from, unless that is inside this repo
4. `defaultCwd` in `config.json`
5. The current folder

A relative `/claude cd` path is resolved against that default. `~` expands to your home folder. The agents keep sessions per folder, so a chat that changes folder starts a fresh session there; the same happens when a chat changes agent.

## Where the bridge keeps its files

The bridge separates what it runs from what it remembers. The code can be replaced (`git pull`, `brew upgrade`, the installer run again) without touching any of the files below, which live in a home folder chosen in this order:

1. `CLAUDE_WOW_HOME`, when set (a leading `~` expands).
2. `~/.claude-wow`, once it holds a `config.json`.
3. The checkout's `bridge/` folder, while it holds a `config.json`: the layout from before there was a home folder. The next `node setup.js` copies `config.json`, `state.json` and `transcripts.json` from there to `~/.claude-wow` (copies, never moves: an older checkout still reads `bridge/`), and the bridge reads them in `~/.claude-wow` from then on. Nothing is ever copied into an explicit `CLAUDE_WOW_HOME`.
4. `~/.claude-wow` otherwise (a fresh install; setup writes the config there).

The bridge's banner prints the folder it chose (`home :`). The one-line installer puts the code in `~/.claude-wow/app`, next to these files; Homebrew keeps the code in its keg and only these files in `~/.claude-wow`.

| File | Contents |
|---|---|
| `~/.claude-wow/config.json` | Your configuration. |
| `~/.claude-wow/state.json` | Agent session ids per chat, the folder and the agent each session ran with, each session's context growth (`sessionUsage`: the tokens the next message carries, turns, the model's window, when it started, its runs at API list prices), handled message ids per addon session token, the presence ring and position (`presence`), the last signal self-test result the addon reported (`presenceTest`), and the latest game context the addon sent (`context`). Delete it to forget all sessions. |
| `~/.claude-wow/transcripts.json` | The last 200 messages of every chat, with the agent that wrote each reply, so the addon can recover its chats after the client wipes saved data. |
| `~/.claude-wow/uijobs/` | One widget command file per running job (`CLAUDE_WOW_UI_FILE`), read and deleted when the job ends. The widgets themselves live in `state.json` (`widgets`). |
| `~/.claude-wow/mapjobs/` | One map command file per running job (`CLAUDE_WOW_MAP_FILE`), read and deleted when the job ends. Map layers themselves live in `state.json` (`map`). |
| `~/.claude-wow/goals/` | One folder per character (`<Name-Realm>/goals.json`): the profession goals and the current order plus the last 20, written only by the bridge when a live session or an in-game `ask` run (through its per-run `wowgoals` server) calls `goal_set` or `order_issue`. A file the bridge cannot read is left alone. In-game agent runs may not edit this folder (`--disallowedTools`). See [LIVE-SESSION.md](LIVE-SESSION.md#goals-and-orders-phase-0). The same folder holds `snapshot.json` (the latest game state, one entry per section with its sequence and hash) `events.jsonl` (rotated to `events.1.jsonl` at 5 MB; 2 files kept) and `observed.jsonl` (vendor prices, auction results and loot samples with their map position, one line each with trust `observed`; rotated to `observed.1.jsonl` at 5 MB; 2 files kept), all written only by the bridge. See [Game state telemetry](#game-state-telemetry). |
| `~/.claude-wow/live.token` | The live-session token, fresh on every bridge start (mode `0600`). In-game agent runs may not read it with the Read tool. |
| `~/.claude-wow/bridge.log` | Every line the bridge logs, with timestamps. Rotated by the supervisor at 5 MB (`bridge.log.1` … `.5` kept), so it never grows without bound. Under the background service the bridge's full output (banner, log lines, crashes) also goes to the service log: `~/Library/Logs/claude-wow/bridge.log` on macOS, `$XDG_STATE_HOME/claude-wow/bridge.log` (default `~/.local/state/claude-wow`) on Linux, `%LocalAppData%\claude-wow\logs\bridge.log` on Windows, rotated the same way; `claude-wow service logs` shows whichever applies. |
| `~/.claude-wow/tmp/` | Prompt files for agents that read the prompt from disk (Grok). Each is deleted when its run ends. |
| `~/.claude-wow/data/forever/`, `~/.claude-wow/data/classic_era/` | Game data from `claude-wow data sync`, one folder per flavor: one folder per client build, a `current` file naming the build in use, and `.sync.lock` while a sync runs. See [Game data](#game-data). |

## Game state telemetry

The addon sends quiet `kind=gs` records with the character's game state: money, level and XP, zone (uiMapID), profession ranks, watched item counts and free bag slots, equipped item IDs, watched factions, deaths and learned recipes, plus what the player saw in windows they opened: vendor prices, auction results of their own searches, and loot with its source and the player's map position (loot only when the synced game data matches the client's build, since the bridge derives the gathering spells from it). Only IDs and numbers, never names. Each record names its character with the key goals use (`Bone-Forever`: the first part of the name, the realm without spaces), so telemetry and `goals.json` share one folder. Two characters on one realm whose names share a first part share that folder, a known limit. The bridge merges them into `goals/<character>/snapshot.json` and appends changes to `events.jsonl`. See [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md#game-state-records-kindgs) for the transport rules.

| Key | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `telemetry.enabled` | `true` | `false` stops advertising `gs` in the slot files, so the addon sends no game state, vendor prices, auction results or loot. Records that still arrive are dropped. |
| `telemetry.watch.items` | none | Items to count in the bags: `{ "<itemID>": <target> }` (target `0` for none) or a plain list of item IDs. At most 20. A count wakes `events --min 2` only when it crosses 25, 50, 75 or 100% of its target. |
| `telemetry.watch.factions` | none | Faction IDs to report standing for, at most 10. The faction on the player's reputation bar is always reported too. |

On Classic Era the auction reads follow Blizzard's rules: the addon never queries, bids, buys or refreshes, and it reads only the result of a search sent through the Blizzard browse function (`AuctionFrameBrowse_Search`). It counts every `QueryAuctionItems` call with `hooksecurefunc`. In `Blizzard_AuctionUI` (hooked when it loads), `AuctionFrameBrowse_Search` calls `DequoteString` and then sends its query, so post-hooks on both mark that search: it counts only when the call sent exactly one query in the same frame and `CanSendAuctionQuery("list")` was true before it. The search text and exact-match flag are the query's own arguments (1 and 8). A list update is read once, and only when no other query ran after the player's search, the auction frame is open, every row that passes the suffix check has a name that contains the search text (ASCII case only, case-sensitive when the text has non-ASCII bytes; the whole name for a quoted search), and the whole result fits on one page (total at most the batch, batch at most 50). An empty search, a bid or buyout (`PlaceAuctionBid`), closing the auction house, or telemetry being off drops the waiting search. Rows with a random suffix are skipped, and a list with a row that has no link or item info yet waits for the refire. Each quote is the lowest buyout per item, rounded up to whole copper, with the items listed, the auction rows and the stack size of the auction that set the price. The ring holds 50 quotes, one full page. The `ah` section sends the newest quotes that fit in 1,200 bytes, and `ClaudeWoWObserved.debug.ahUnsent` counts the ones left out. See [LIVE-SESSION.md](LIVE-SESSION.md) for how quotes differ between Forever and Era.

In the game, `/claude config telemetry off` (or **Send game state, prices and loot to Claude** in the chat list's gear menu) stops it, including the vendor, auction and loot reads, and so does `/claude config context off`. Records ride on screenshots the addon takes anyway for messages; a screenshot of its own happens at most once every 2 minutes, after a change, or within 5 s of a level up, death or new recipe. Like every message shot, a telemetry-only shot makes the client show its own "screen captured" text: in the `forever` UI source, `Blizzard_ActionStatus` (both its Classic and Mainline files) shows `SCREENSHOT_SUCCESS` on `SCREENSHOT_SUCCEEDED` and fades it out over 2 s, and plays no sound; the addon does not hide it. Not yet checked in the game which of the two files Forever loads.

Event importance: 1 money and item ticks, skill, gear and reputation changes; 2 a watched count crossing a threshold, a zone change, bags full, a new reputation rank; 3 level up, death, a new recipe, a watched item reaching its target (`goal_complete`, once per target). `claude-wow events --follow` merges events that arrive within 10 s into one burst (per kind: the first `from`, the last `to`), prints one JSON line per event, and prints at most 40 bursts an hour; later events wait, merged, until the hour frees a slot.

### Daily report

`claude-wow report --day 2026-10-01` reads only the character's `events.jsonl` and `events.1.jsonl`, `snapshot.json` and `goals.json`; it needs no model and no network. Game things appear by ID (`Skill 393`, `Item 2318`, `maps 1420`), never by name, and an event whose fields are not whole numbers is skipped. Every order text and goal title goes through the order text validator again before it prints, with the character's first name, the bridge's own profession names and the names an order or goal stored in its checked `refs` as the only allowed names; a text that fails prints `(not shown: it fails the text check)`. Only the last 20 orders are kept, so a busy day can show fewer orders than were issued. Goal progress comes from the snapshot's `skills` and `equip` sections.

Nothing schedules it. Two ways to run it daily, neither installed by the bridge:

- **launchd (macOS):** a LaunchAgent with `ProgramArguments` `["/usr/local/bin/claude-wow", "report", "--day"]`, `StartCalendarInterval` `{ "Hour": 23, "Minute": 55 }` and `StandardOutPath` set to a file you choose, loaded with `launchctl bootstrap gui/$(id -u) <plist>`. It runs on this machine, where the goals folder is.
- **A live session:** `/loop 24h run claude-wow report --day and summarize it` in the Claude Code session that has the channel. Cloud routines cannot reach `~/.claude-wow`.

## Twitch votes

| Key | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `votes.channel` | none (votes off) | The Twitch channel name whose chat counts `!1` to `!3` while a `goal_vote_open` vote runs (3 to 25 letters, digits or `_`; a leading `#` is dropped). The bridge connects only while a vote is open, anonymously and read-only. Read at bridge start. See [LIVE-SESSION.md](LIVE-SESSION.md#gear-sets-and-twitch-votes-phase-3). |

## Game data

`claude-wow data sync` caches Blizzard client tables (DB2) from wago.tools on this machine, one folder per game (flavor). The data is never committed to this repository or shipped with a release.

| Flavor | Game | Client builds | wago.tools product | Default family |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `forever` | World of Warcraft: Forever | `1.60.*` | `wow_cn_beta` | `1.60.1` |
| `classic_era` | World of Warcraft Classic (Classic Era, interface 115xx) | `1.15.*` | `wow_classic_era` | `1.15.9` |

- **Which flavor is used:** the bridge reads the client build from the game context's `Game:` line and uses the flavor whose client builds it matches: `1.15.*` reads `data/classic_era/`, `1.60.*` reads `data/forever/`. It never falls back to the other flavor. With no data synced for the client's flavor, a client build in neither list, or no client build yet, there is no game data: tokens are refused, the phrase check uses only the built-in list, the gather list is empty (no loot capture) and `ask` runs go without the `wowdata` server. The bridge logs which sync command is missing. A data folder whose manifest names another flavor is not read.
- **Era tables:** `1.15.9.70003` (the live Era client's own build) has every table and column below; it synced 39,234 rows with none dropped. Its gather list has 14 spells with the roots 2366, 2575 and 8613.

- **Source:** `https://wago.tools/api/builds` lists the builds; each table comes from `https://wago.tools/db2/<Table>/csv?build=<build>`. A table is accepted only when wago.tools names the file `<Table>.<build>.csv`. Redirects are refused, and a body over 64 MB is cut off while it streams.
- **Community data (Classic Era only):** `claude-wow data sync --flavor classic_era --source community` adds NPC names and titles, NPC and quest-object spawn points, quest titles and quest givers and enders from the cMaNGOS `classic-db` dump (`github.com/cmangos/classic-db`, GPL-3.0, a community rebuild of the 1.12 world). It reads the folder listing from the GitHub API, takes the one `Full_DB/ClassicDB_1_12_1_z<rev>.sql.gz`, downloads it from `raw.githubusercontent.com` (at most 64 MB, no redirects), checks it against the git blob sha the listing gives, unpacks it to at most 256 MB and reads the dump's INSERT rows in memory (no database server, no SQLite). Rows named like unused or developer content (`[UNUSED]`, `<NYI>`, `Trigger`, `Credit Marker`, and for NPCs `Test Dummy`, `(TEST)`, `DND`, `Placeholder` and similar) are dropped and counted; a real NPC such as a combat dummy is kept. A world event's NPC that takes another NPC's place counts once per spot. A dump whose NPC or quest table converts to nothing is refused, and so is any INSERT for a table it reads in a form other than the plain multi-row `INSERT INTO` ... `VALUES` one (a column list, no backticks, another spacing), so a layout change never replaces good data with empty data. Spawn points, including the NPCs a world event puts in another NPC's place, become map percent with the client's own `UiMapAssignment` rectangles, so the client tables must be synced first. Each NPC keeps every map it stands on (`onMaps`, with a count and one position each, an ordinary spawn's position before an event-only one, flagged `zoneAmbiguous` or `event` like that spawn) and a sample of 25 spawns spread over those maps. The manifest records the converter's `shape`; a store of another shape is not read, and the next sync converts again. The manifest records the client build and table hash it used: a community sync is not skipped when either changes, and while they differ from the current client data, `wowdata` leaves the coordinates out and says which command recomputes them. It writes `data/classic_era/community/<rev>-<sha7>/` (`npcs`, `questinfo`, `objects`) with its own `current` pointer, lock and swap, so a client re-sync never removes it. Every row is `trust: community-db`, never `client-data`: the names are 1.12 names (Classic Era renamed some NPCs and items; see the measurement below), and the client has no NPC names or quest titles to check them against. No levels, factions, loot, vendor or trainer data is read. Reference tokens in orders still refuse `{npc:ID}` and `{quest:ID}`: no community name reaches the stream overlay. A GitHub rate limit (60 unauthenticated requests an hour) fails the sync with the time to try again. Measured with `z2815` on 2026-10-02: 9,902 NPCs, 4,245 quests (3,532 of them in the Era client), 237 quest objects, 482 rows dropped (481 named like unused or developer content, 1 empty name), 55 of 17,593 shared item IDs (0.31%, exact compare) named differently in Era, about 10 MB on disk, 3 s and 580 MB of memory.
- **Layout:** `data/<flavor>/<build>/` holds one JSON Lines file per entity and a `manifest.json`. A sync writes `<build>.tmp`, renames it to a folder name that is not in use (`<build>`, or `<build>-1` on a `--force` re-sync of the current build), then points the `current` file at that folder. Only then does it delete the older copy of that build and any stray `.tmp` or `.old` folder; a delete that fails is logged and does not fail the sync. `current` holds the folder name, so read it with `readCurrent()`, which gives `build` and `dir`. A failed sync deletes its `.tmp` folder and leaves the previous build current.
- **Lock:** `.sync.lock` is linked into place already written, so it is never empty. A lock whose holder is dead or older than 30 minutes is taken over; an unreadable lock counts as held until its file is 30 minutes old. Only one process at a time may take over a stale lock, and it deletes the lock only if it is still the one it judged stale.

| File | Table | Fields |
|---|---|---|
| `items.jsonl` | `ItemSparse` | `id`, `name`, `quality`, `itemLevel`, `requiredLevel`, `inventoryType`, `sellPrice`, `buyPrice`, `startQuestID` |
| `quests.jsonl` | `QuestV2` | `id` only. The client tables carry no quest titles or text. |
| `zones.jsonl` | `AreaTable` | `id`, `name`, `continentID`, `parentAreaID` |
| `flightpaths.jsonl` | `TaxiNodes` | `id`, `name`, `continentID`, `flags` (raw), `world` (`x`, `y`, `z`), `map`, `maps`, `zoneAmbiguous` |
| `uimaps.jsonl` | `UiMap` | `id`, `name`, `parentUiMapID`, `type`, `system` |
| `uimapassignments.jsonl` | `UiMapAssignment` | `id`, `uiMapID`, `mapID`, `areaID`, `orderIndex`, `uiMin`, `uiMax`, `region` |
| `skilllines.jsonl` | `SkillLine` | `id`, `name`, `categoryID`, `parentSkillLineID` |
| `skilllineabilities.jsonl` | `SkillLineAbility` | `id`, `skillLine`, `spell`, `minSkillRank`, `trivialLow`, `trivialHigh`, `acquireMethod`, `supercedesSpell` |
| `spellreagents.jsonl` | `SpellReagents` | `id`, `spellID`, `reagents` (`itemID`, `count`) |

- **Checks:** IDs are positive integers, numbers are finite, names are 1 to 120 characters with no control, format (bidi, zero-width) or line-separator characters and no `|` (whitespace at the ends, NBSP included, is trimmed). A row that fails is dropped and counted by reason in the manifest (`tables.<Table>.droppedBy`). A required table with a missing column, or with no valid row, fails the whole sync. `SkillLineAbility` and `SpellReagents` are optional: when one fails, the manifest records `tables.<Table>.error`, its file is left out, and the sync goes on.
- **Map positions:** `maps` lists the flight path's position, in percent, on every world map (`UiMap` system 0 first) whose `UiMapAssignment` rectangle holds it. `map` is the single zone that holds it. When two zone rectangles overlap there (`zoneAmbiguous: true`), `map` is the continent instead, because the rectangles alone cannot say which zone is right. City flight paths land here too: in `1.60.1.70094` a city's `ParentUiMapID` is its continent, not its zone, so the parent links cannot break the tie either. The city position is still in `maps`. On Classic Era `1.15.9.70003`, 54 of the 87 flight paths are `zoneAmbiguous` (Forever `1.60.1.70094`: 65 of 100): Era's zone rectangles overlap widely. No tie-break picks the smaller zone, because the smallest rectangle is not always the zone the flight path is in; such a flight path keeps the continent as `map`.
- **Builds:** a build string must match `^\d+\.\d+\.\d+\.\d+$` before it is used in a path or a URL. Without `--build`, the sync takes the newest build in the flavor's default family and refuses to move `current` to a build of another family. The manifest records `flavor`, `product`, `buildFamily` (`1.60.1` or `1.15.9`), a SHA-256 per table and a combined `tableHash`. When the next sync is in the same family, `previous.changedTables` names the tables whose hash changed.

### The wowdata server

`claude-wow data-mcp` serves the current build read-only over MCP (stdio). It reads the `current` pointer once when it starts and loads each table the first time a tool needs it. Each `ask` run starts its own copy, so a sync reaches the next run.

| Tool | Input | Answers with |
|---|---|---|
| `wow_item` | `id` or `name`, `limit` | Item fields, `startsQuest` (`id`, `inClientData`), and by ID `reagentIn`: up to 25 recipes (spell ID, count, and every skill line the spell is in with its `minSkillRank`) that use it, with `reagentInTotal`. A name search returns no recipes. No drop sources or vendors. |
| `wow_quest` | `id` or `name`, `limit` | Whether the ID is in the client quest table, and `startedByItems`. `title` is always `null`: the client tables have no quest titles or text. On Classic Era with community data synced, a `community` block adds the title and the NPCs or objects that give and end the quest (an object comes with the maps it stands on and up to 5 of its spawns, dungeon ones included, since no other tool looks objects up; `source: cmangos`, `trust: community-db`), and `name` searches titles (a note says when several quests share a title). A quest only community data has is answered with `trust: community-db` and a note that it may not exist in this game. |
| `wow_npc` | `id` or `name`, `uiMapID`, `limit` | Classic Era community data only: NPC name and title, every quest it gives and ends (with titles), `spawnTotal`, `onMaps` (every world map it stands on, with a count and one position) and a sample of up to 25 spawns spread over those maps, each with every world map that holds it (`zoneAmbiguous` when zone rectangles overlap, `event` for a world-event spawn, `shared` for one of several NPCs that can appear at that spot, `instanceMapID` for a dungeon spawn no world map holds). `uiMapID` adds `onMap` (that map's entry from `onMaps`), keeps the sampled spawns on that map and, with `name`, keeps the NPCs that stand on it. No levels, factions or other numbers. Without community data the answer is empty with a note naming the sync command. |
| `wow_flights` | `id`, `name` or `uiMapID`, `limit` | Flight paths with `map`, `maps` (percent positions with map names), `zoneAmbiguous`, raw `flags` (faction is not decoded) and `onMap` for a `uiMapID` query. |
| `wow_where` | `name` or `uiMapID`, `limit` | By name: maps (`uiMapID`, type, parent), areas (with the maps they are on) and flight paths, best match first. By `uiMapID`: that map's ancestors, up to 50 children (`childrenTotal`, `childrenTruncated`) and flight path count. No NPC or object positions. |
| `wow_sources` | none | Source, URL, product, build, build family, fetch time, license note, table hash, rows per table and `notInData`. With Classic Era community data, a second row with its source, version, file, license note, the client data it was computed with and `positionsCurrent`. |

- **Every answer** is one JSON object (also sent as `structuredContent`) with `found`, `flavor`, `source`, `build`, `clientBuild`, `buildCheck`, `trust`, `total`, `truncated`, `unavailable`, `results` and `notes`. Each row carries `source`, `build` and `trust` too. `trust` is `client-data` for rows from the tables when the client build is in the data's family, `unverified-build-mismatch` when it is not, `client-data-build-unchecked` when the client build is unknown, and `none` when nothing was found. `limit` takes an integer or a digit string, like the IDs.
- **Unavailable tables:** a table file that is missing, has a line that is not a valid row, or has another row count than the manifest is not used. It is named in `unavailable` with a note, so an empty answer from it never reads as "not in the client data". A join that needs it gives `null` (`startsQuest.inClientData`, `reagentIn`, `skillLines`). Names are data in fields; the server's instructions tell the model never to follow them.
- **`buildCheck`:** the server opens the flavor that matches the client build (read from the situation block's `Game:` line); `--flavor` opens one by name instead, which only tests use. `exact` or `family` when the client build is in the data's build family, `build-mismatch` when it is not (the answer then carries a note that the rows are unverified for this client), `unknown` without a client build (with a note that the rows are not checked against the client), and `no-data` when nothing is synced.
- **How `ask` runs get it:** for the Claude agent only, the bridge passes `--mcp-config` with a server named `wowdata` whose command is the bridge's own absolute command (`node bridge/datamcp.js` from a checkout, `claude-wow data-mcp` from the binary) and `alwaysLoad: true`, and adds `mcp__wowdata` to `--allowedTools` for that run only. Nothing is written to `config.json`, and your own MCP servers still load (no `--strict-mcp-config`). Coding runs and the other agents do not get it. With no synced data for the client's flavor the run goes without it, and the bridge logs that once with the sync command it needs; a data build outside the client's build family is logged once as well. The run log names the build and flavor (`wowdata 1.15.9.70003 classic_era`). The same `--mcp-config` also holds the per-run `wowgoals` server while the live socket listens, with its eleven `mcp__wowgoals__<tool>` rules added for that run only and never saved ([LIVE-SESSION.md](LIVE-SESSION.md#goals-orders-and-campaigns-from-in-game-chats)).
- **Reference tokens:** `bridge/gamerefs.js` turns `{item:ID}`, `{skill:ID}` and `{map:ID,x,y}` (x and y in 0 to 100) into canonical names from the same data, for example `Linen Cloth` or `Silverpine Forest`. A map token shows only the map's name: its x and y are the model's estimate, so they are kept in the token's ref as `point` with `trust: "model"` and never shown as fact. An unknown ID, a malformed token, coordinates over 100, a kind with no names in the data (`{quest:ID}`, `{npc:ID}`, `{faction:ID}`), no synced data, a build mismatch, an unknown client build or an unavailable table rejects the whole text with the reason per token, as does a name in the data with any character outside `A-Z a-z 0-9`, space and `, . ' - : ! ? %`, and a token that touches a letter, a digit or another token. Orders (`order_issue`) go through it, with the word allowlist on the text around the tokens; the data is opened with the client build from the current game context. The same data also feeds a phrase check on orders and the roast card: a run of 2 to 4 words within one clause that is an area, map, skill line or flight path name, a spell a spell-book or recipe item teaches (other item names are not used), or in `bridge/game-phrases.json`, is refused unless a token, a reported name or the death recap supplied it. The synced tables have no spell or NPC names, so that check misses ability and NPC phrases not in the built-in list. The roast stream card takes no tokens (any brace drops its line).
- **Spell tokens in chat replies:** before a reply, or the progress shown while the agent works, is published (`bridge/replytokens.js`, after macro blocks become text), a `{spell:ID}` stays a link only when the player linked that spell in the chat: a `spell` or `enchant` (recipe) line under "Linked from the game" in one of the chat's last 200 messages, as the transcript keeps them. Any other spell token becomes plain text, `spell 123 (unverified)`, because the synced data has no spell names and the client draws a real link for almost any spell ID. This includes tokens inside fenced code, since the addon draws links there too. Item and quest tokens are not changed: the client grays an item ID it lacks, and a quest shows only when it is in the quest log. The bridge logs `reply tokens: N spell token(s) not linked in this chat, shown as plain text: spell:<id>, ...`. Plugins (the roast card) get the reply before this change.

## `setup.js` flags

| Flag | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `--wow "<client folder>"` | The folder containing `Wow*.exe` and `Interface\`, when auto-detection fails. |
| `--project "<dir>"` | Written to `defaultCwd`. Defaults to the folder you ran setup from. |
| `--account <name>` | Which `WTF\Account\<name>` to use when there are several. |

Re-running `setup.js` re-copies the addon (except `Inbox.lua`, which the bridge owns once running), keeps an existing `config.json` (adding the `agents` blocks and fixing paths if it predates them), and only creates slot and signal files that are missing. An install under one of the project's old names (the `WoWAI` addon, or `WoWClaude` before it) is migrated: its saved data is copied to `ClaudeWoW.lua` with the globals renamed so chats survive (the old file is kept), the old addon and slot folders are removed, and `inboxFile` / `savedVariablesFile` in an old `config.json` are rewritten.
